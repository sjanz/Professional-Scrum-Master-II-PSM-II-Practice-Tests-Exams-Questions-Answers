### An organization has just hired you as a new Scrum Master to help them transition their teams from their current traditional process to Scrum. The teams are currently structured to specialize in a single function. This is also known as component teams where a team would only address a single layer (i.e. design, frontend, backend, database, testing, etc.). You've introduced the concept of cross-functional teams where all the skills needed to produce business functionality, from end to end, are inside of a single team. What should you keep in mind when transitioning from siloed teams to cross-functional teams? (Choose two.)

- [ ] It is easier to compare the performance between cross-functional teams in order to identify to which teams to assign tasks and which teams need additional coaching.
- [x] Newly formed teams will need time to stabilize before reaching their peak performance. During the initial stages of forming, performance will suffer and productivity may be low, although even then delivery of business value is still likely to increase.
- [ ] Without feature teams, you cannot do Scrum. Postpone Scrum adoption until the teams are reorganized in feature teams.
- [x] People from the different layers and components will need time to become accustomed to working and delivering unified functionality together as one Scrum Team thus productivity may suffer.

### Paul is a Product Owner for multiple products. Each product is allocated a dedicated Scrum Team and a set budget. Based on the average velocity of a previous product release, Paul had estimated a new product to take 9 Sprints to complete. The average velocity of the previous product release was 50 completed units of work per Sprint. Over the first 3 Sprints, the Development Team reported an average velocity of 40 completed units per Sprint, while not fully completing the required integration tests. The Development Team estimates that integration testing would require additional effort to make the increments shippable. TheDevelopment Team is unsure if the required velocity is achievable. What is the most effective way to recover?

- [ ] In the next Sprints, the Development Team strives to make the selected work as close to 'done' as possible and at the minimum 90% completed. Any undone work is divided into new Product Backlog Items that will be deferred to the last Sprint in order to maintain stable velocity.
- [x] The Development Team informs Paul that the progress he has perceived to date is not correct. The Increment is not releasable. They give Paul their estimate of the effort it would take to get the previous work 'done', and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The team also re-estimates the effort to make the remaining Product Backlog items 'done', including all integration effort. In the end, it is Paul's call to continue the project or to cancel.
- [ ] The Scrum Master will manage the Sprint Backlog and assign work to the Development Team members to ensure maximum utilization of each member. He/ she will keep track of unused resources so that it does not impact the budget. Unused budget can be allocated for additional Sprints if needed.
- [ ] The Scrum Master sets the open work aside to be performed in one or more release Sprints. They remind Paul to find funding for enough Release Sprints in which this remaining work can be done. Up to one release Sprint per three development Sprints may be required. It is Paul's role to inform users and stakeholders of the impact on the release date.

- [ ] Ask Paul to stop attending the Daily Scrum.
- [x] Coach Paul and Development Team members on the purpose of the Scrum events and let them figure out what to do in this situation.
- [ ] Allow the Paul to participate in the Daily Scrum as he is responsible for the success of the product.
- [ ] Facilitate the Daily Scrums to avoid any conflicts between the Development Team members and Paul.

### Steven, the Scrum Master, is approached by one of the Development Team members saying that they are not completing regression tests for all of the work they are performing to the level defined in the Definition of Done. They have discussed this with the Product Owner and decided to remove regression testing from the Definition of Done. Which two actions are the most appropriate for Steven to take? (Choose two.)

- [ ] Reject the decision as the long term maintainability of the product will be negatively impacted by modifying the Definition of Done.
- [ ] Accept the decision as a mutual agreement has been made between the Development Team and the Product Owner.
- [x] Ask the Development Team and the Product Owner what problem they are trying to solve by altering the Definition of Done and removing regression testing from it. In what ways will this decision impact transparency and quality?
- [x] Ask the Development Team and the Product Owner if they are still able to produce potentially shippable product increments by altering the Definition of Done?

What should Steven, the Scrum Master, do to solve this potential problem?

- [ ] Manage the items in the Sprint Backlogs so that Dan can be utilized evenly for each team.
- [ ] Assign Dan to the team with the most urgent tasks first and then move him to the next team and so on until the required support is completed.
- [x] Facilitate a discussion with all Development Teams on how they want to deal with this issue, and help them implement their preferred solution.
- [ ] Ask Dan to work with the HR department to recruit and hire additional database specialists. In the meantime, have the Product Owner move items that do not depend on Dan to the top of the Product Backlog.

### A Development Team has a total of six members, 4 members who work full time in the office and 2 members who work part time at home. The Development Team is complaining that it is too difficult to synchronize every day and has suggested having the Daily Scrum every other day instead. What would be three key concerns if the Daily Scrum is held less frequently? (Choose three.)

- [x] Impediments are raised and resolved more slowly.
- [x] Opportunities to inspect and adapt the Sprint Backlog are reduced.
- [x] Less information about the progress will be shared causing the Sprint plan to become inaccurate and reducing transparency over progress toward the Sprint Goal.
- [ ] The Scrum Master loses the ability to update the burndown chart adequately.
- [ ] The Product Owner cannot accurately inspect utilization of the individual team members.

### Steven is a Scrum Master asked to assist in creating five new Scrum Teams that will be working to build a highly anticipated product. He talks with them about the importance of being able to integrate their Increments by the end of their Sprints. This includes the first Sprints. The product is very important to both the end users and the organization. Of the choices raised by future team members, what would Steven encourage?

- [ ] Each Scrum Team delivers Increments in its own code branch. After UAT is performed at the Sprint Review, the code branch is isolated until enough Increments are considered acceptable. All code branches will then be merged during the release phase.
- [ ] Each Scrum Team delivers functionality at the end of each Sprint. New Product Backlog items will then be added to the next Sprint Backlog to integrate their functionality with the other teams to create a unified Increment.
- [x] All Scrum Teams agree on a mutual understanding of 'done' that defines all work necessary to deliver a potentially shippable Increment that includes all previous Increments delivered for the product.

The Product Owner, however, was able to clearly define the business objective he hopes to achieve in the Sprint. Which of the following two actions would you support? (Choose two.)

- [x] The Development Team forecasts the most likely Product Backlog items to meet the business objective and create a Sprint Backlog based on a likely initial design and plan. Once the time- box for the Sprint Planning meeting is over, they start implementation and continue to analyze, decompose, and create additional functionality during the Sprint.
- [ ] If all agree they can extend the Sprint Planning until the Development Team can forecast enough Product Backlog items before starting the implementation.
- [ ] Allow the Development Team members as much time as needed to review the Product Backlog items and reconvene with the Product Owner when they are confident enough to make a forecast for the Sprint.
- [x] They discuss in the upcoming Sprint Retrospective why this happened and what changes will make it less likely to occur again.

The Product Owner is also expected to invite the right stakeholders to the Sprint Review meeting.
- [ ] You inform the Product Owner that, in today's highly competitive markets, it is important that the Development Team is updated on changing business priorities on a daily basis. The Daily Scrum allows the Development Team to adapt to the changes in scope without delay.
- [ ] You tell the Product Owner to make sure that there are no ambiguities or possible misunderstandings in the items on the Product Backlog when they are handed over to the Development Team. This is best done by capturing the functional requirements during an analysis phase, resulting in documents that are considered as the working product of such analysis Sprints.
- [x] You advise the Product Owner to rely on the Development Team and the stakeholders to formulate the Product Backlog, as they are the ones most knowledgeable. By asking questions and working with them the Product Owner will quickly be up to speed.

What are the two best responses for Steven to explain how such work is handled in Scrum? (Choose two.)

- [ ] You explain that product management should not worry about technical solutions. You inform them that the developers will work with the IT department when needed and keep the Product Owner updated on additional time required for each Sprint. The additional effort will be added to the top of the Sprint Backlog before Sprint Planning.
- [x] You explain that it is more effective when architecture and infrastructure emerge alongside the development of business functionality. The additional advantage is that business value is created more quickly and earlier.
- [ ] You confirm that architecture and infrastructure is needed before starting on business functionality but the estimated budget will be difficult to estimate. You suggest that the first Sprint will be dedicated towards building the technical foundation in order to get an accurate estimation for any additional budget and time required.
- [x] You coach the Product Owner and Development Team to add this work to Product Backlog to ensure transparency, have the Development Team estimate the work and do this in early Sprints while also creating some business functionality in the early Sprints.

### Your company has notified the stakeholders that they will be delivering the first release of a new product within ten Sprints. On the seventh Sprint, the ScrumTeam discovers that they will not be able to include all of the expected features within the first release. The Product Owner believes if they remove some items from the Definition of Done they will be able to accelerate the development process. The Development Team objects to this idea as it will lead to technical debt. As a Scrum Master, what would be the best two ways to explain to the Product Owner the impact of technical debt? (Choose two.)

- [ ] As long as there is still technical debt in the current release, feature development for the next release cannot be started. The Product Owner must first agree to this impact before allowing changes to the Definition of Done.
- [ ] Reducing the Definition of Done will introduce unknown errors as development progresses and functionality is added. The system can become more difficult to stabilize as work progresses. Development for the actual release as well as future releases will be slowed down in unpredictable ways.
- [x] Releasing the version upon a reduced Definition of Done creates false assumptions about the actual state of the system. This will create many interruptions during the development of the next release as fixes will need to be done to the previous release caused from a reduction of quality.
- [x] The amount of technical debt will need to be analyzed in order to understand the impact on subsequent releases in order to allocate additional Sprints at the end of the project.

- [ ] It depends on the team's Definition of Done.
- [ ] Yes, because the Development Team is a self-organizing team and should not be disrupted during development.
- [ ] Yes, because UAT is done in a hardening Sprint before the release Sprint.

He asks Steven, the team's Scrum Master, to increase his team's velocity. Which would be the best two responses for Steven to take? (Choose two.)

- [x] He explains how a team uses the velocity of a Sprint primarily to forecast work for the next Sprint, not to perfectly predict future productivity. He refers the director to the Product Owner for all information concerning the progress of development.
- [x] He informs the director of organizational impediments he is aware of that prevent the team from being more productive. He suggests collaborating with him on how to remove these impediments.
- [ ] He educates his director how it is part of a team's self-organization to improve velocity. He invites the director to the next Sprint Retrospective to brainstorm on how they can improve.
- [ ] He helps the director understand that it typically takes a few Sprints for a team to gradually increase the velocity up to the level expected. Meanwhile he presents this to the team as a challenge and a company goal, leaving it however up to them to figure out exactly how to achieve this.
- [ ]  He tells the director that this is not his responsibility in Scrum. He tells the director to work with the Product Owner to check whether the estimates on the Product Backlog are being respected during implementation.
